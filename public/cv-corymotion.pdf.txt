This is a placeholder for the CV PDF file. 
You should replace this with the actual PDF version of the CV.

To create the actual PDF:
1. You can use the browser's print function on the CV page
2. Or create a professional PDF using tools like Adobe Acrobat
3. Or use online HTML to PDF converters

The file should be named "cv-corymotion.pdf" and placed in the public folder.
